# 👋 Hi, I'm Kenzhebek Taniyev  
🚀 Machine Learning & Backend Engineer | Researcher in Computer Vision and NLP  

I'm passionate about building **intelligent, production-ready AI systems** that bridge research and real-world applications.  
My work spans **computer vision**, **natural language processing**, and **multimodal systems**, with experience in both academic research and large-scale deployments.

I enjoy developing end-to-end pipelines — from **LLM agents**, **RAG systems**, and **LoRA fine-tuning** to **real-time CV inference** and **MLOps automation** using **Docker**, **Airflow**, and **Supabase**.  
Beyond applied projects, I’ve published in **IEEE Access** and **IEEE GRSL (Q1, H-index 165)** on **action recognition**, **transformer architectures**, and **federated learning** for aerial video understanding.

### 🧠 Research & Publications

- 🕹️ [Multi-Stream GCN and CNN for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10831761) — *IEEE Access, 2024*  
  Combines **GCN** and **CNN** streams for position–velocity feature learning in skeleton-based action recognition, achieving **state-of-the-art results** on **JHMDB** and **Kinetics-400** with fewer parameters.

- 🧩 [Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10908313) — *IEEE GRSL, 2024*  
  Introduces a **Transformer encoder** with **contrastive self-supervised learning** to capture **spatial–temporal dependencies**, enabling efficient recognition with minimal labeled data.

- 🛰️ *Upcoming:* **Federated Aerial Video Captioning with Effective Temporal Adaptation** — *Under review at IEEE GRSL (Q1, H-index 165)*  
  Proposes a **federated learning** approach for **aerial video captioning**, integrating **temporal adaptation** and **privacy-preserving** model updates for distributed UAV systems.

### 🤖 Applied AI & Engineering Work

Beyond research, I build real-world AI systems integrating both **NLP** and **Computer Vision** components:

- 💬 **Voice & Chat Intelligence** — Implemented **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** pipelines with RAG-based contextual reasoning for multimodal assistants.  
- 🧠 **RAG + LLM Agents** — Built **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** systems using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **vLLM**, powering intelligent assistants for **ZamanBank** and **legal-tech** domains.  
- 🪶 **LoRA & Fine-Tuning** — Applied **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** (LoRA, PEFT) for domain-specific LLMs and **vision-language** models.  
- 🎥 **Computer Vision Systems** — Developed real-time **YOLO-based tracking**, **PPE detection**, and **industrial safety** analytics on edge GPUs.  
- ⚙️ **MLOps & Automation** — Orchestrated **Airflow** DAGs, **Dockerized** microservices, and **Supabase/Elasticsearch** backends for scalable AI deployments.  
- 🔊 **Multimodal Integration** — Combined **LLMs**, **speech models**, and **visual encoders** to create interactive assistants capable of understanding and responding across text, voice, and image modalities.
